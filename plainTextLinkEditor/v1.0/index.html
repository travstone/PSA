	<!-- IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
		
		THE FOLLOWING MARKUP SHOWS THE REQUIRED CLASSES AND STRUCTURE THAT MUST BE PRESENT FOR THE API TO WORK
		NOTE THAT THERE ARE TWO INSTANCES PRESENT
		
		the outer container has a class of 'editor-instance'
		
		The buttons all have classes that begin with 'action-...'
		
		the 'View Link' button is actually an anchor, to make things easier. this is styled to match the other editor buttons
		
		the actual textarea must have the class 'editor'
		
		need to have a div for error messages
		
		Included in this demo markup are a number of Bootstrap classes that aren't needed for component to function
		
		See simpleTextEditor.js for the minimum viable markup requirements

<p>Re being uniquely ETS, I think my <a href="http://www.example.com/index1.html">approach</a> (alternative 1 below) is actually different than Proteach (alternative 2), so I think we're safe, but see what you think:</p>
<p>1. Show link text only (my proposal)</p>

<p>My proposal to show the link text within brackets -- [link text] -- but not <a href="http://www.example.com/index2.html">surface</a> the actual href there because that was closest to the requirements I saw and also that's the simplest for the user (and us!).  Of course we have to keep track of those hrefs, and pair them to [link text]s, but not displaying them is simpler than <a href="http://www.example.com/index3.html">surfacing</a> them for a few reasons. You have the popup selector to choose them and this is the simplest way to prevent the user from modifying the href such that it might not match an uploaded asset.</p>

<p>2. Show link text and link href (Proteach's approach)</p>

<p>This sounds like what Proteach did, if I understand correctly. This is less compatible with the popup you already have which seems like a nice feature to keep and more powerful than Proteach.  Before alternative 1, I actually considered showing links as:</p>
